  <h1>InstaLy</h1>
  <p>An LSPosed module that hands Instagram back to you. Privacy, downloads, a cleaner feed, your own look, and a pile of quality-of-life fixes, all toggled from inside the app.</p>

  <p><b>InstaLy</b> is a maintained compatibility fork of <a href="https://github.com/ReSo7200/InstaEclipse">InstaEclipse</a>. The Android package id is intentionally preserved so existing users can update without losing preferences or LSPosed scope.</p>

## What is it

InstaLy is a module for [LSPosed](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed) (rooted) and [LSPatch](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch) (no root). Once it is enabled, a long press on the search icon inside Instagram opens a settings sheet where you flip features on and off. No restart needed for most of them.

There is also a small companion app that ships alongside it. That is where you check module status, read the live logs, back up your settings, and open the theme editor.

The whole thing leans on [DexKit](https://github.com/LuckyPray/DexKit) to find Instagram's classes and methods at runtime instead of hard-coding them. In plain terms: when Instagram ships an update and shuffles its code around, InstaLy re-finds what it needs on the next launch rather than breaking outright. It will not survive every update untouched, but it holds up far better than a module pinned to fixed names.

## Compatibility

InstaLy is designed to keep up with Instagram automatically, but no module is bulletproof. A big Instagram update can still knock a feature out until it is patched. If something breaks right after an update, check the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/InstaEclipse) before opening an issue, there is a good chance it is already known.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Compatibility target** | `449.0.0.30.84` (`385509876`) |
| **Previous tested baseline** | `447.0.0.21.81` |
| **Recommended build** | Beta or Alpha, from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/) |
| **Runtime compatibility** | Split-aware DexKit scanning plus a framework lifecycle fallback; one failed feature hook no longer disables the rest of the module |
| **Startup behavior** | Heavy DexKit discovery runs on a low-priority background installer so Instagram's Application.attach path is not blocked by the full hook scan |

---

## Installation

> Grab Instagram from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/) rather than the Play Store. The Play build is not always fully supported.

Download the latest InstaLy APK from [**Releases**](https://github.com/mochibunr/InstaLy/releases/latest), then follow the path that matches your setup.

### Rooted, with LSPosed

> Needs [JingMatrix's LSPosed](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed/releases/latest).

1. **Install InstaLy.** Open the APK you downloaded and install it.
2. **Enable the module.** Open LSPosed Manager, go to Modules, find InstaLy, enable it, and scope it to Instagram.
3. **Restart Instagram.** Force stop it, then open it again.
4. **Open the menu.** Long press the search icon inside Instagram.

> [!CAUTION]
> Using Hide My Applist? Do not add InstaLy to the hidden list. Instagram needs to see it. Hiding it causes crashes and features that silently stop working.

### No root, with LSPatch

> Needs [JingMatrix's LSPatch](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch/releases/latest).

1. **Install InstaLy.** Open the APK and install it.
2. **Install LSPatch** (the JingMatrix fork).
3. **Patch Instagram.** In LSPatch, tap **+**, pick the Instagram APK or the installed app, choose **Local Patch Mode**, turn on **Inject loader dex**, then tap **Start Patch** and wait.
4. **Install the patched APK** it produces, and log in to Instagram.
5. **Enable the module.** Back in LSPatch, go to Manage, find Instagram, open Modules, and enable InstaLy.
6. **Open the menu.** Long press the search icon inside Instagram.

---

## Opening the menu

Long press the search icon inside Instagram and the InstaLy sheet slides up. Features are grouped into Appearance, Privacy, Media, and Tools, and most take effect the moment you toggle them.

## FAQ

**A feature is not doing anything.**
Disable and re-enable the module in LSPosed or LSPatch, then force stop and reopen Instagram. That reloads the hooks cleanly.

**Developer Options labels show up as numbers.**
That is obfuscation on Instagram's Stable build. Switch to a Beta or Alpha build from APKMirror.

**I turned on Distraction-Free but the content is still there.**
Force stop Instagram and clear its cache after enabling it, then reopen.

**It is not working on the Play Store version.**
Install Instagram from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/) instead.

**Some features still will not work even when enabled.**
Instagram's own internal config can silently block certain features. There is a ready-made config that clears the common ones, and InstaLy ships it as the default under Developer Options, Restore Default Config. You can also grab it from [Telegram](https://t.me/InstaEclipse/52).

**Still stuck.**
Drop into the [Telegram group](https://t.me/instaEclipse_discussion) and ask. Someone will point you in the right direction.
